<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This program (<em>v.net.models</em>) performs model-based generation/reconstruction of
network edges (links), given an input map with network nodes.  
<p>
Its intended purpose is to serve as a research tool: Using a number of simple connectivity
models, <em>v.net.models</em> will generate maps of network links that serve as a baseline
for exploring alternative network structures or comparing against the results of more complex reconstruction and
simulation models. One possible application area is the reconstruction of historical networks
given solely the locations of known places that can be assumed to have been part of the
same network.
<p>
To produce more realistic models, a raster cost map can be provided as additional input, in
which case the reconstructed network links will represent least-cost paths rather than straight-line
distances.
<p>
A very basic "social space" connectivity model, based on similarities of attribute field contents,
is also available. This is intended solely for comparison with the "physical space"
connectivity models in <em>v.net.models</em> and not as a replacement for a "proper" Social Network
Analysis (SNA) tool.
<p>
Flexible options exist for filtering the nodes that go into the reconstruction, and the
program's output is enriched with useful statistics in the output map/s attribute table/s.

<div id="h2_input"></div>
<h2>INPUT</h2>

Minimal input (option <em>"input="</em>) consists of a map of (at least two) points, that represent the nodes of a
(hypothetical or real) network. The attribute table of the input points map must contain at least
one field that stores a unique primary key value for each point. The name of this field must be
provided using option <em>"key="</em>, and it must <em>not</em> be the default GRASS primary key field (usually "cat").
To make the output more legible, a second attribute field, containing a more verbatim label text 
for each input node, is recommended. A label field name can be provided via <em>"label="</em>.
<p>
Using option <em>"initial="</em>, it is possible to load an initial model into the program. The
main purpose of this is to provide a caching mechanism for better performance (see "HINTS for
details). Note that the initial model must be a vector lines map that contains the same attribute
table schema which the output of <em>v.net.models</em> would also contain (if in doubt: generate
a new output and look at the attribute table fields that this program adds to it). Output maps
produced by <em>v.net.models</em> itself should never cause any issues.
<p>
Computation of least-cost path representations of network links (instead of straight lines) requires
an additional cost model, to be provided in a raster map specified via option <em>"costmap="</em>. 
If a cost map is provided, then only input points in the current GRASS region will be processed,
and there must be at least two points in the current region
Additionally, if a cost map is provided, then it must have non-NULL cells in the current region.
If no cost map is provided, processing is done for all (filtered) input points.
<p>
Further details on program input can be found in <a href="#h2_flags_and_parameters">flags and parameters</a>.
<p>
The input data is never modified by <em>v.net.models</em>.

<div id="h2_processing"></div>
<h2>PROCESSING</h2>

This program will read the points in the input map or a subset of them (if any of the data selection
options/flags are used: see <a href="#h2_flags_and_parameters">flags and parameters</a>). It will then generate a set of new lines (links)
to connect all, some or none of the points in the input data, depending on the chosen connectivity
model (option <em>"model="</em>) and its parameters.
<p>
The following connectivity model choices have been implemented (in alphabetical order):
<dl>
	<dt><em>attsim</em></dt>
	<dd>Connects two points if they share identical content in at least on attribute field.</dd>
	<dt><em>complete</em></dt>
	<dd>Connects every point in the input map to all other points.</dd>
	<dt><em>delaunay</em></dt>
	<dd>Connects points using the edges of a minimum set of triangles.</dd>
	<dt><em>nn</em></dt>
	<dd>Connects each point with its <em>n</em> nearest neighbours.</dd>
	<dt><em>xtent</em></dt>
	<dd>Connects two points if their combined connection strengths exceed the distance between them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Of the models above, "attsim" and "xtent" require additional attributes in the input points map 
(see "MODEL DETAILS").
<p>
Additionally, it is always possible to enforce a cut-off distance for all connections using option
<em>"maxdist="</em>. No links will be established between points that are more than this distance
(or cost, if a cost surface is also provided) apart from each other, regardless of any other model parameters.
Using option <em>"maxdist="</em> in conjunction with model type "complete" therefore provides a very basic "maximum connection distance/cost" model.
<p>
Further instructions on how to control the processing can be found below, in <a href="#h2_flags_and_parameters">flags and parameters</a>. 
<p>
This program is very strict about correctness of parameters. If invalid option values, contradictory
option and/or flag specifications, or related issues are detected, processing will abort with a descriptive error
message.
<br>

<div id="h2_output"></div>
<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

Program output consists of two new vector maps: one (geometry type "line") for the generated links
(option <em>"links="</em>), and another one (geometry type "point") for all retained nodes (option <em>"nodes="</em>).

Each line in the links output map (specified by <em>"links="</em>) will contain the following attribute fields:
<dl>
	<dt><em>from_id</em>, <em>to_id</em></dt>
	<dd>"IDs of linked nodes" (integer): IDs (as given by "<em>key=</em>") of the two nodes connected by this link.</dd>
	<dt><em>from_lbl</em>, <em>to_lbl</em></dt>
	<dd>"Labels of linked nodes" (any type): Labels (as given by "<em>label=</em>") of the two nodes connected by this link.</dd>
	<dt><em>from_x</em>, <em>from_y</em>, <em>to_x</em>, <em>to_y</em></dt>
	<dd>"Coordinates of linked nodes" (double): Coordinates of the two nodes connected by this link.</dd>
	<dt><em>length_m</em>, <em>length_km</em></dt>
	<dd>"Length of link" (double): Length of this link in <em>m</em> and <em>km</em> units.</dd>
</dl>

Each point in the nodes output map (specified by <em>"nodes="</em>) will retain the original attribute
fields of the corresponding point in the input map (<em>"input="</em>), and the following fields will be added: 
<dl>
	<dt><em>coordx</em>, <em>coordy</em>, <em>coordz</em></dt>
	<dd>"Coordinate X/Y/Z" (double): Coordinates of this nodes.</dd>
	<dt><em>links</em>, <em>coordy</em>, <em>coordz</em></dt>
	<dd>"Incoming links" (integer): Number of links connected to this node.</dd>
	<dt><em>len_sum</em>, <em>double</em>, <em>coordz</em></dt>
	<dd>"Total length of incoming links" (double): Sum of lengths (m) of all incoming links at this node.</dd>
	<dt><em>len_mean</em>, <em>double</em>, <em>coordz</em></dt>
	<dd>"Mean length of incoming links" (double) Mean length (m) of incoming links at this node..</dd>
</dl>

Note: All of the attribute field names listed above are reserved for the operation of
<em>v.net.models</em>, which means that they must not be present in the input data!
<p>
In addition, the program will print summary statistics on all nodes and links in the output.

<div id="h2_model_details"></div>
<h2>MODEL DETAILS</h2>

This section provides details on the available choices for option <em>"model="</em>. Note that
only one model can be computed in one run of <em>v.net.models</em>. Except for "complete", each model
uses at least one formal <em>connection criterion</em> to decide which points of the input map to
connect. Depending on the model used, connection criteria might be completely data-driven or have
to by supplied using the appropriate program option(s). A connection is represented as a link
(in the output vector map set by <em>"links="</em>) that takes either the form of a simple straight
line segment or a complex least-cost path (if <em>"costmap="</em> is provided).
<p>
Note that all models connect suitable point pairs via a <em>shared</em> link. 
This implies that a link from point <em>A</em> to point <em>B</em> does at the same time represent
a link from point <em>B</em> to point <em>A</em> (i.e. <em>A->B</em> == <em>B->A</em>).
<p>
Note also that option <em>"maxdist="</em> can be used to introduce an additional connectivity limit
(by absolute distance or cost) that will be respected by all model choices. "Distance" is measured
as straight-line Euclidean distance by default, as cumulative cost along a least-cost path (if a cost
surface is provided via "<em>costmap=</em>" or an initial model with a "cost" attribute is provided
via "<em>initial=</em>"), or as on-the-ground distance along a least-cost path, if the <em>-m</em>
flag is also set.

<div id="h3_attsim"></div>
<h3>attsim</h3>

Model choice "attsim" provides rudimentary social network modelling capabilities. Its purpose
is to provide a simple means of exploring which nodes of the network share common attributes that
<em>might</em> be the results of direct or indirect connections. It also provides a base for comparison
with models that use spatial connectivity criteria (i.e. all other model choices).
<p>
Setting <em>"model=attsim"</em> requires option <em>"attributes="</em> to be specified, as well.
The latter must be a list with one or more names of fields (comma separated) that exist in the input
points map.
<p>
The contents of all fields listed in <em>"attributes="</em> will be compared across all input points.
Two points will be connected if they have at least on field's content in common. Comparison of field
contents is exact and case sensitive. Empty field contents are allowed.
<p>
Each point in the links output map (specified by <em>"links="</em>) will be attributed with an
additional field:
<dl>
	<dt><em>strength</em></dt>
	<dd>"Link strength" (integer): The sum of attribute similarities (number of fields with identical contents) represented by this link.</dd>
</dl>
Each point in the nodes output map (specified by <em>"nodes="</em>) will also be attributed with an
additional field:
<dl>
	<dt><em>nstrength</em></dt>
	<dd>"Node strength" (integer): The sum of "link strength" (see above) of all links connected to this node.</dd>
</dl>
<p>

<div id="h3_complete"></div>
<h3>complete</h3>

Setting <em>"model=complete"</em> will connect every point in the input map with every other point.
The number of links (<em>x</em>) in a fully connected network is given by: <em>x = n(n - 1) / 2</em>, with <em>n</em>
being the number of points in the input map.
<p>
In addition, this model choice serves a special purpose, as it will also be computed initially if not
chosen explicitely. The reason for this is that <em>v.net.models</em> implements a unified
computational approach: It always computes a complete model first, then reduces the number of
links according to the connectivity criterion of another model (if applicable). The main advantage
of this is that, in many cases, it will be sufficient to compute the complete connectivity model
only once (setting <em>"model=complete"</em>) and storing it. For every subsequent run on an
unmodified set of input points, the stored complete model can be reloaded using <em>"initial="</em>.

<div id="h3_delaunay"></div>
<h3>delaunay</h3>
Setting <em>"model=delaunay"</em> will connect every point in the input map with all neighbouring points
that would also share an edge in a Delaunay triangulation. To perform the latter, 
<em><a href="v.delaunay.html">v.delaunay</a></em> is used.
  
<div id="h3_nn"></div>
<h3>nn</h3>
Model choice "nn" provides a simple "<em>n</em> nearest neighbors" connectivity model. The number
of neighboring nodes to connect with each node (<em>n</em>) can be set using "<em>neighbors=</em>" or
read for each input point individually, from the attribute table field specified via "<em>size=</em>".
<p>
For each point (=node) in the input map, <em>n</em> links are generated, connecting that node and the
<em>n</em> nearest nodes around it. "Nearness" is measured as straight-line Euclidean distance by
default, as cumulative cost along a least-cost path if a cost surface is provided ("<em>costmap=</em>"),
or as on-the-ground distance along a least-cost path, if the <em>-m</em> flag is also given.

<div id="h3_xtent"></div>
<h3>xtent</h3>
Model choice "xtent" provides a more advanced connectivity model that, in addition to linking
distances/costs, takes node "size" (weight, ranking, etc.) into account and allows for balancing
between the two when determining which nodes to connect. The intention behind this is to provide
a simple way for including (node-based) hierarchy.
<p>
The original XTENT model is an example of a simple gravity model that was conceived for computing
areas of influence (territories) around central sites (see Renfrew & Level 1979):
<p>
<em>I = C^a - k*d</em>
<p>
In the formula above, <em>I</em> is the influence that a center exerts on a given location.
The basic idea is that each location will be allocated to the center (i.e. part of its territory) that
scores the highest <em>I</em> at that location. The magnitude of <em>I</em> at a location is
determined for each center by two terms that are weighted against each other:
center weight (or size) <em>C</em> and distance <em>d</em>. Obviously, a large center in close proximity
will have the best chance to score the highest <em>I</em> (i.e. "dominate" a location). But a very large
center can still be dominant, even if it is farther away.
<p>
The two coefficients <em>a</em> and <em>k</em> determine the balance between center size and distance. 
The importance of distance increases in a linear manner while the importance of size increases exponentially. 
Thus, larger centers will compete stronger in relation to smaller ones, even at an increased distance.
<p>
This program implements a version of XTENT that has been slightly modified to work with network
data, but retains XTENT's original principles. In this case, the network nodes represent
the centers (<em>C</em>), and <em>I</em> serves as connectivity criterion: Two nodes will be
connect if their combined influence is > 0. The outcome is independent of direction, i.e. it does
not matter whether <em>I</em> of node <em>A</em> is computed at node <em>B</em> or vice versa.     
<p>
Since cost-based distances do not always relate (easily) to simple spatial distances, it
can be exceedingly hard to find ranges for the <em>a</em> and <em>k</em> parameters that
will overlap well enough to produce stable results. For this reason, the modified version of XTENT
used here preforms simple normalization of the "C" term by both (cost) distance and maximum
"size". This also implies that neither cost distances nor node "sizes" have to be expressed as
real-world physical units. "Size" can represent population estimates, resources but also simple rankings
or scores to express relative differences in node weights: 
<p>
<em>I = ( C^a * ( avg(d) / max(C) ) ) - k*d</em>
<p>
Global model parameters <em>a</em> and <em>k</em> are set via options <em>"a="</em> and <em>"k="</em>,
respectively; while <em>C</em> is read individually for each point in the input map, from the
(numeric) attribute field specified via <em>"a=size"</em>. In addition, the averaging function <em>avg(d)</em>
can be chosen using option <em>avg=</em>. 
<p>
Distance <em>d</em> is measured as straight-line Euclidean distance by default, as cumulative cost
along a least-cost path (if a cost surface is provided via "<em>costmap=</em>" or an initial model
with a "cost" attribute is provided via "<em>initial=</em>"), or as on-the-ground distance along a
least-cost path, if the <em>-m</em> flag is also set.

<h2>FURTHER USAGE NOTES</h2>

<div id="h3_using_an_initial_links_map"></div>
<h3>Using an initial links map</h3>
- using initial=
- several strict tests on the map and its attribute table schema are performed
- can also be used to test applicability of built-in models given externally created links!  
- must have all required attributes
- length_m/km will be computed on-the-fly if they are missing
- if map has no cost field, it will be added and its data computed if "cost=" is also provided
- providing both "cost=" and an initial links map with a cost attribute is ambiguous and will produce an error
- if any missing attributes are added, they will be added to an internal copy of the initial links map; the original data will never be touched.
- to keep an amended version of an initial links input map, run a "complete" model with a "maxdist=" setting that exceeds the length of any of the links in the map. 
- attribute-stored coordinates from/to x/y can also be computed on-the-fly, but ONLY PAIRWISE
- if distance and coordinate atts exist, then they must be valid: Some models (delaunay!) depend on comparing coordinates!
    Initial links will first be snapped to input nodes, then coordinate fields will be updated
- initial links must match input nodes!

<div id="h2_flags_and_parameters"></div>
<h2>FLAGS AND PARAMETERS</h2>
The following contains a complete list of the flags and options (=parameters) available in <em>v.net.models</em>.
Extended descriptions are provided for those items which are not self-explanatory or have not
been discussed in more specific context in any of the previous sections.

<div id="h3_flags"></div>
<h3>Flags</h3>
<dl>
	<dt><em>-d</em> [Drop unconnected nodes from output map]</dt>
	<dd>If this flag is set, then the nodes output map
	(specified by <em>"nodes="</em>) will only contain those nodes that are connected to
	at least one other node. Otherwise, all points of the input map will end up as nodes
	in the nodes output map.</dd>
	<dt><em>-g</em> [Global network statistics output in shell script style]</dt>
	<dd>At the end of reach run, <em>v.net.models</em> prints a number of useful statistics
	on the properties of the generated network. If this flag is set, then they will be printed
	in a condensed style (<em>"variable=value"</em>), suitable for ingestion by an <em>eval</em>
	or similar command.</dd>
	<dt><em>-m</em> [Measure least-cost paths in meters instead of costs]</dt>
	<dd>Several of the models implemented in <em>v.net.models</em> implement some sort of
	distance measure when deciding which nodes to connect. This distance is either measured
	in meters or as cumulative costs along least-cost paths. Normally, cost-based computations
	are triggered automatically if a cost surface is supplied as additional program input.
	But by setting this flag, it is possible to force <em>v.net.models</em> to measure the
	lengths of least-cost paths and use that instead of the least-cost path costs.
	Please see NOTES ON COST-BASED OPERATION for details.</dd>
	<dt><em>-r</em> [Reduce input points to those in current region]</dt>
	<dd>Normally, all points in the input map specified by <em>input=</em> will be considered
	network nodes and processed accordingly. By setting this flag, the input points are
	reduced to only those that lie within the extents of the current GRASS computational
	region (see <em><a href="g.region">g.region</a></em>).</dd>
</dl>

<div id="h3_parameters"></div>
<h3>Parameters (options)</h3>

Note: Mandatory parameters are marked with an asterisk ("*") in the list below.

<dl>
	<dt><em>input</em>* [Input vector map with network nodes (points)]</dt>
	<dd>This map constitutes the essential input data for <em>v.net.models</em>.
	it must contain points that represent the given nodes of the network.
	The set of nodes that will be considered for network generation can be
	reduced to a subset by one of the data selection options below.</dd>
	<dt><em>layer</em> [Layer number or name (default: 1)]</dt>
	<dd>GRASS GIS allows the geometries in a map to be connected to more
	than one attribute table. The different tables are called "layers".
	By default, attributes are stored in "layer 1". This option can be used
	to select another attributes "layer" if applicable.</dd>
	<dt><em>cats</em> [Category values]</dt>	
	<dd>GRASS GIS refers to its default primary keys for attribute data
	as "categories" (cats). Every geometry that has an associated attribute
	record has a unique "cat" value. This is an integer type value that is
	unique for each record and refers to the currently connected "layer"
	(see above). The "<em>cats=</em>" option can be used to reduce the
	input points to only those whose primary keys fall into a given
	"cats set". Sets can be specified as single values or ranges, and
	more than one set can be specified, e.g.: "cats=1,3,5-8,12"</dd>
	<dt><em>where</em> [WHERE conditions of SQL statement without 'where' keyword]</dt>
	<dd>This option provides the most flexible way of reducing the input data
	to a subset by using an SQL "where" clause (only the clause statement, without
	the "where" keyword). E.g. assuming that the input data has a field of
	type integer called "index", then a subset of input points can be selected
	that have an "index" value greater than "10": "where=index>10"</dd>
	<dt><em>initial</em> [Initial links produced by previous run (lines)]</dt>
	<dd>This option allows loading the links computed by a previous run of <em>v.net.models</em>.
	This is useful for every type of model except "complete"
	(see <a href="#h3_notes_on_performance">notes on performance</a> for details).</dd>	
	<dt><em>costmap</em> [Input raster map with (global and isotropic) cost surface]</dt>
	<dd>To produce more realistic output, <em>v.net.models</em> can connect nodes
	with least-cost paths instead of straight-line links. For this purpose, an additional
	input raster with a predefined cost surface must be provided.
	See <a href="#h3_notes_on_cost-based_operation">notes on cost-based operation</a> for details.</dd>
	<dt><em>links*</em> [Output vector map for reconstructed network links (lines)]</dt>
	<dd>This option specifies the output map in which <em>v.net.models</em> will store
	the generated network links as vector lines.</dd>
	<dt><em>nodes*</em> [Output vector map for attributed network nodes (points)]</dt>
	<dd>This option specifies the output map in which <em>v.net.models</em> will store
	the network nodes. These are different from the original input points, since
	some new attributes will be added. In addition, the output nodes might represent
	a subset of the input points, if one of the options for input data reduction
	is used (<em>"-r, cats=, where="</em>).</dd>
	<dt><em>key*</em> [Name of integer key field in input points' attribute table]</dt>
	<dd>This option must be set to the name of an attribute of type integer that serves
	to uniquely identify each point in the input map. The field must contain a unique
	value for each point (node), and it must <em>not</em> be the primary key field that GRASS
	GIS uses by default (normally: "cat").</dd>
	<dt><em>label</em> [Name of label/name field (default: same as 'key')]</dt>
	<dd>While each node in the input map is uniquely identified via its primary key
	(as specified by option <em>"key="</em>), an additional field (of any type) can be specified
	via <em>"label=</em> that can contain e.g. text data with 'proper' place names for
	all input nodes. These will be used for more verbose data in the attribute tables
	of links and nodes output maps. The contents of this field do not have to be unique
	for each node. If a label field is not specified, then the primary keys will be used
	for labelling output data.</dd>
	<dt><em>model*</em> [Choice of network connectivity model (default: <a href="#h3_complete">complete</a>)]</dt>
	<dd><a href="#h2_model_details">h2_model_details</a></dd>

<h2>USAGE EXAMPLES</h2>


<div id="h2_caveats"></div>
<h2>CAVEATS</h2>
When running in cost-based mode, this program will consume large
amounts of storage space for temporary raster maps. This space will
only be freed, once the program has completed or has been aborted
by the user.
<p>
The underlying cost model is isotropic, i.e. there is no
(relevant) difference between connecting "directions" A->B and B->A in terms
of distance and/or cost. By extension, this also means that there will
always be only one link between A and B. There is no provision for
modelling the case where A->B requires a different link than B->A.
Note that it is possible to circumvent the isotropic cost restriction
by precomputing least cost paths on an anisotropic cost map (using e.g. <em><a href="r.walk.html">r.walk</a></em>)
and specifying option <em>"initial="</em> to load them, but the latter constraint (single linkage) still holds.
<p>
Least-cost path computations suffer from edge effect:
if a lower-cost past exists through a "hinterland" that is
not part of the current region, then it will not be found.
To mitigate this problem, the input cost map should cover
the extent of the input points plus a significant "buffer zone".
<p>
There is no guarantee for topological correctness of the this program's output.
In fact, most models are likely to produce topologically flawed
