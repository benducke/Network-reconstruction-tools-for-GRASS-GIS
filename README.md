# v.net.models
Node-based network model generator for GRASS GIS 7.x

Takes a vector points layer as input, produces a new vector lines layer that represents the links of the reconstructed network.
Several connectivity models have been implemented to drive the reconstructions.

Linux users: Simply make this script executable and run it from within a GRASS session (tested with GRASS 7.8).
Windows users: You need to create a DOS ".BAT" file so that Windows can run this.
